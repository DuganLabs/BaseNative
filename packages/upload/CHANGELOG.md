# @basenative/upload

## 0.3.4

### Patch Changes

- ae4701e: First release on npmjs.org. `@basenative/*` moves off GitHub Packages, so installing any package no longer needs a token.

  Every package now declares a `types` condition for each JavaScript subpath, so TypeScript finds the declarations under `moduleResolution: "bundler"` and `"node16"`; ships without its test files; declares `sideEffects` for bundlers; and is published with an npm provenance attestation through trusted publishing.

  The version moves even where the code did not: the same version number already exists on GitHub Packages with different contents, and reusing it on npm would fail a consumer's lockfile integrity check when it switches registry.

## 0.3.3

### Patch Changes

- 9741b75: Public-readiness metadata sweep, no behavior change:

  - Add a per-package `LICENSE` file (Apache-2.0) — previously only the repo root
    carried one, so it was never included in the published tarball.
  - Fix `repository.url`/`homepage`/`bugs.url` to the correct `DuganLabs/BaseNative`
    casing with a `git+` prefix on `repository.url`, matching npm's convention; add
    the `bugs` field to `@basenative/eslint-config` and `@basenative/tsconfig`, which
    were missing it.
  - Normalize `publishConfig` to `{ "access": "public" }` across every publishable
    package. The previous per-package `registry` override duplicated the scope
    mapping `.npmrc` already sets for `@basenative:*` (and that the Release/publish
    workflows reassert via `actions/setup-node`'s `registry-url`/`scope` inputs), so
    it only added drift risk and would have blocked a future npmjs registry target.
  - Fix README `## License` sections that said `MIT` while `package.json` and the
    repo `LICENSE` say `Apache-2.0` (`auth`, `config`, `date`, `db`, `fetch`, `flags`,
    `fonts`, `forms`, `i18n`, `icons`, `logger`, `marketplace`, `middleware`,
    `notify`, `realtime`, `router`, `runtime`, `server`, `tenant`, `upload`,
    `visual-builder`); add a missing `## License` section to `builder` and `evals`.
  - Add the missing `README.md` for `@basenative/integrations` (Plaid Link +
    accounts/transfers, and the pure float-yield-optimization math).

  No `private`/version/`exports` changes. `@basenative/evals`, `fonts`, and `icons`
  stay private and are not part of this changeset.

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- aa71b9e: Fix CodeQL `js/remote-property-injection` (alert #35) by storing parsed multipart header names in a `Map` instead of a plain object, eliminating the dynamic-property-write sink entirely for this internal, never-exposed header store.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- e2748d8: Fix a prototype-pollution surface (CodeQL `js/remote-property-injection`) in the built-in multipart parser: header names parsed from the request body were written onto a plain `{}` object, so a crafted `__proto__` header name reached `Object.prototype`. The per-part headers object is now created with `Object.create(null)`. No change to the parsed shape returned to callers.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- fdfa251: v1.0 release readiness: comprehensive test coverage, complete documentation, deployment examples, and CI/CD hardening.
  - 682 tests across all 21 packages (was ~250)
  - Package-level READMEs for npm publishing
  - Cloudflare Workers and Node.js deployment examples
  - CLAUDE.md for AI assistant guidance
  - Root README rewrite for open-source audience
  - All package.json files have complete npm publishing metadata
